# Mock Mode Configuration (DEPRECATED)
#
# Mock mode is now controlled via Debug panel, not environment variables.
#
# To enable mock mode:
# 1. Start app: npm run tauri dev
# 2. Type 'debug' anywhere to unlock Debug panel
# 3. Navigate to Debug tab → Mock Mode dropdown
# 4. Select "Online (Mock API)"
#
# The setting persists to SQLite and restores on app restart.
# See docs/operations/DEBUG_PANEL.md for details.
#
# This file is kept for reference only.
