Clean up memory

1. Read .claude/MEMORY.md, count entries in each section
2. Check if cleanup needed (any section >10 entries, or entries >3 months old)
3. Cleanup actions:
   - Move expired/redundant content to .claude/archive/YYYY-MM.md
   - Merge similar entries
   - Remove outdated content
   - Keep valuable core information
4. Report results: how many removed, how many kept
