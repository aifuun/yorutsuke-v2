# Planning Templates

Standardized templates for feature planning and issue triage.

## 🎯 Quick Decision Tree

**Situation**: A new GitHub issue appeared  
→ Use: [TEMPLATE-issue-triage.md](TEMPLATE-issue-triage.md)  
→ Save as: `plans/active/#99-issue.md`  
→ Make decision: Needs Clarification | Ready for Planning | Duplicate | Won't Fix

**Situation**: Ready to develop a specific feature  
→ Use: [TEMPLATE-feature-plan.md](TEMPLATE-feature-plan.md)  
→ Save as: `plans/active/#100-feature-name.md`  
→ Complete all sections, then start development

## 📚 Integration with Workflow

These templates are part of Phase B (Planning):

**Step 1: MVP-Level Decomposition** (40 min)
→ [planning-mvp.md](../planning-mvp.md)
- Fast feature identification, no templates needed

**Step 2: Feature-Level Planning** (1-2h per feature)
→ [planning-feature.md](../planning-feature.md)
- Use [TEMPLATE-feature-plan.md](TEMPLATE-feature-plan.md)
- Detailed implementation planning

**Issue Triage** (as needed)
- Use [TEMPLATE-issue-triage.md](TEMPLATE-issue-triage.md)
- Before feature planning or during issue evaluation

## 💡 Tips

1. **Both templates are guides, not checklists**
   - Adapt sections to your needs
   - Skip irrelevant sections
   - Add sections if needed

2. **Keep templates updated**
   - As you learn new patterns
   - When team processes change
   - Templates should reflect your reality

3. **Use in workflow**
   - Copy template → save to `plans/active/`
   - Edit and complete during planning
   - Reference during development
   - Move to `plans/archive/` when done
